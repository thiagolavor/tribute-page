            <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span>1914</span>- Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li><span>1933</span>- Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br> to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration" </li>
                <li><span>1935</span>- Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
                <li><span>1937</span>- Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                <li><span>1938</span>- Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants. </li>
                <li><span>1941</span>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br>to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science</li>
                <li><span>1942</span>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li><span>1944</span>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth. </li>
                <li><span>1945</span>- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat<br> yields </li>
                <li><span>1953</span>- crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat. </li>
                <li><span>1962</span>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br>subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population </li>
                <li><span>1970</span>- receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li><span>1983</span>- helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br>sorghum yields </li>
                <li><span>2005</span>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best <br>breeds." </li>
                <li><span>2009</span>- dies at the age of 95.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution<br> that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make<br> to human peace and progress."  
            </p>
            <p>-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</p>
